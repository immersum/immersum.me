Home renovation meant removing a section of the doorbell wiring from the walls. Rather than
choosing to rewire the push button, I decided to use this as an opportunity to put my newly
acquired Rust knowledge into practice and get hands-on with embedded systems, designing and
installing a wireless replacement system.

To this day, the system and its software remains in active use.
